                <p style="font-size: small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Minecraft wiki covers the most basic part of the game.  Including the info of some of the mobs and items but not all of them.  There is thousands of items and mobs in Minecraft and it can be really hard to know all of them.  People think the game is kind of basic, but that is wrong.  There is endless possibilities when you are playing Minecraft.  Minecraft is not free however, I think Mojang really need to change that to make sure more people can access and experience Minecraft.  There is currently a "free version" of Minecraft.  It is called Minecraft Education, the game is not completely free since it requires a school or organizational accout.  The school or organization that is providing you the opportunity to play Minecraft needs to pay for the game.  Therefore it is not completely free.  You can still play the demo version of Minecraft: Java Edition and Bedrock Edition for free though!</p>
